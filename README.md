The Virtual Logbook and Course Hours Tracking web application is designed to help users keep track of different topics taught during courses and the number of hours spent on these courses. The application is structured to support both regular users and class delegates/prefects. Here’s a detailed overview of the system's functionalities, architecture, and instructions on how to set up and run the application.
Key Features
- User Roles: The application supports two types of users:
- Regular Users: These users belong to a particular class and can view logbook entries for their courses.
- Class Delegates/Prefects: These users also belong to a particular class but have additional responsibilities, including filling out the logbook and tracking course hours.
- Logbook Entries: Class delegates/prefects can create logbook entries that include:
- Subject: The course for which the entry is being made.
- Date: The specific day the entry pertains to.
- Period: The start and end times of the teaching session.
- Teacher: The teacher who conducted the session.
- Text: Detailed notes or descriptions of the session.
- Attachments: One or more files (images, audio, etc.) related to the session.
- Automatic Hour Logging: The application automatically logs the number of hours a teacher has taught a particular course whenever a logbook entry is created.
- Course Views: Regular users can view a list of courses and see all logbook entries associated with a selected course.
